                        according to Mastercard</a>'s 2019 Global Destination Cities Index.
                        <br>
                        It's by far the largest city in Thailand with an estimated population of 10.539 million as of 2020, 15.3% of the country's population.
                        Because of the investment boom in the 1980s and 1990s, the city has become a big force in finance, business and an emerging centre for arts,
                        fashion and entertainment.
                        It is known for its exquisite temples and palaces, authentic canals, traditional markets and a vibrant nightlife. 
                        <br>
                        Since the 1990s the city has relied on investment on public transportation, there are several lines of rapid transit, including the Metropolitan
                        Rapid Transit (MRT), Airport Rail Link (ARL) and its famous BTS Skytrain.

                        Started off as a small village on the west side of the Chao Phraya River, after the fall of Ayutthaya, an ancient capital 85km north of Bangkok,
                        King Taksin the Great turned the village into Siam's new capital and renamed it Thonburi.
                        <br>
                        In 1782, King Rama I moved the capital to the east side of the river at Rattanakosin, today known as the historic centre of Bangkok including sights
                        like the Grand Palace and the Wat Pho, naming the city King Thep, which is the Thai name and it translates to english as "City of Angels".
                        <br>
                        Bangkok started a fast development after World War II establishing itself as the driving factor in the country's new role as a newly industrializing
                        country from 1980s onwards.
                        <br>
                        The rapid expansion of Bangkok with little urban planning, an inadequate road network and with an increase in private car usage has led to constant
                        traffic congestion problems.
